Weather app
===========

Create simple Android app for weather forecast. The app should support Android Gingerbread (API level 10) and newer.

See wireframes and use provided graphics. Follow our uLikeIT [Android Coding Guidelines](https://github.com/uLikeIT/Training/blob/master/Android/Guidelines/GUIDELINES.md) and [Android Design Guidelines](https://developer.android.com/design/index.html). Following these guidelines is very important to us. Keep it in mind.

Use [World Weather Online API](http://www.worldweatheronline.com/free-weather-feed.aspx). Fetch data from server in JSON format. Use geolocation for determining current position of the device. Load weather icons asynchronously from World Weather Online server. Commit your source code to a Git repository. When you are done, send us link to the Git repository and APK file.

Optional tasks:
- Use database for storing cities and showing weather for different cities.
- Optimize layout for 7' and 10' tablets.
- Feel free to implement some special feature, effect or animation.
